DebugStickMod
=======
A very simple 1.21.1 neoforge mod that allows players to use the debug stick in survival mode. It can be crafted from a stick and a chorus fruit.

Installation information
=======

Simply create a new repository cloned from this one, by following the
instructions provided by [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Once you have your clone, simply open the repository in the IDE of your choice. The usual recommendation for an IDE is either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can
run `./gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `./gradlew clean` to reset everything 
{this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.

Build information
=======
Run `./gradlew build` and copy the result jar file from `build/libs/`
